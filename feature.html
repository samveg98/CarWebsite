<h1>Future-oriented assistance systems.</h1>

<p>The new C-Class Coupé and Cabriolet features the latest Mercedes-Benz driving assistance systems offering the driver cooperative support, and therefore provides a higher level of active safety than its predecessor. The C-Class is able to drive semi-autonomously in certain situations. The C-Class also uses map and navigation data for assistance functions. For example, Active Distance Control DISTRONIC as part of the Driving Assistance Package is able to give the driver map-based support in numerous situations, and predictively adjust the speed. Other new developments include intuitively understandable Active Lane Change Assist and Active Emergency Stop Assist as new functions of Active Steering Assist.</p>

<h1>MULTIBEAM LED headlamps.</h1>
<p>MULTIBEAM LED headlamps are new and available on request in the Coupé and Cabriolet. Each headlamp incorporates 84 individually controllable LEDs. These allow extremely quick and precise, electronically controlled adjustment of the headlamps to suit the current traffic situation. In high-beam mode, Adaptive Highbeam Assist Plus enables continuous long-range illumination of the road ahead without dazzling oncoming traffic. When no other road user is detected, the road ahead is straight and the vehicle speed is above 40 km/h, ULTRA RANGE high beam is switched on automatically. When there are oncoming vehicles or vehicles ahead, the LEDs of the main beam modules are partially switched off, masking out a U-shaped area of the light beam.</p>
