<p>Just a few weeks after the world premiere of the saloon and estate the two-door version of the C-Class proves it is also enjoying its new top form with the Coupé and Cabriolet. Sportiness and driving pleasure have been enhanced with a sharper design, digital cockpit and DYNAMIC BODY CONTROL suspension. New four-cylinder engines, some of which are equipped with 48 V technology (EQ Boost) underscore the dynamic nature of this highly emotively appealing C-Class representative. Coupé and Cabriolet will celebrate their world premiere at the New York International Auto Show. The two-door vehicles will be available at sales partners from July.</p>

       <h1> More dynamic design. </h1>

<p>The new-look C-Class combines emotionality with intelligence. The vehicle’s appearance is defined in particular by its front and tail end and the design of the headlamps and tail lights. The front design exudes sportiness and lifestyle at first glance. Powerful styling elements such as the new bumper and the standard-fit diamond radiator grille lend the two-door C-Class models an individual character. The standard-fit LED High Performance headlamps are now standard and in their new design they have an especially distinctive appearance. Due to the autonomous design with the dynamic details and standard-fit two-pipe exhaust system (petrol engines) the rear view appears broad and agile.</p>

        <h1> AMG Line: sporty design features heightened. </h1>

<p>The AMG Line exterior includes, for example, the diamond radiator grille with pins in chrome plus an AMG-specific front apron with new geometry, sporty air intakes and its chromed trim element. The exterior with the Night Package, available for the cabriolet for the first time, sports an even more athletic look with its black design features. A particular highlight both day and night are the redesigned, more accentuated all-LED rear lamps. </p>
